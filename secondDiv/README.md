These routines demonstrate the Second Derivative difference attack, so-called because we look for a pair of answers that differ differently from all the other pairs of answers. This attack is just called the difference attack in the Extended Diffix paper.

## getPotentialDiffAttacks.pl

This routine searches the prior known database for potential difference attacks, and generates the pair of SQL queries necessary to run the difference attack. Note that this routine does not compute the alpha needed for the alpha-kappa score. This is left for a future version.

### To run

perl getPotentialDiffAttacks.pl

## simpleDiffAttack.pl

This attack exploits the ability to isolate a user using a negative condition based on knowledge of one or more columns. It uses as input the SQL queries generated by getPotentialDiffAttacks.pl.

The attack generates two histograms on an unknown column, one for buckets that exclude the victim, and one for buckets that conditionally include the victim. The attack then looks for a histogram bucket pair that differs by a different value from how the other bucket pairs differ.

The attack keeps a running tally of confidence improvement. It ignores queries where all bucket pairs differ by the same amount (which would be because the victim's value was low-count filtered).

perl simpleDiffAttack.pl
